Hello Ricers, So to be clear I am not using a WM and goofy stuff, Its me, my laptop and my Gnome desktop. I dont like the normal ubuntu or gnome layout but like the workflow and the simplicity. I love GTK apps because they are simple but I dont really use them because I use things like nitrogen, ranger and some other things. 
I dont like the soft corners or the rounded corners because they are not consistent because some apps have all the corners rounded and some dont. I also dont use any app runner like Rofi or Dmenu or anything. 



I use Pop shell for tiling like everybody and you should too. I am not using the POP shell from Pop!_OS but Sharp Shell which is customized by me which have no rounded corners also I dont have the active window borders dark but they are thin.
