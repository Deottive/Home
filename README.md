## Home 🏚️
Hello Ricers, So to be clear I am not using a WM and goofy stuff, Its me, my laptop and my Gnome desktop. I dont like the normal ubuntu or gnome layout but like the workflow and the simplicity. I love GTK apps because they are simple but I dont really use them because I use things like nitrogen, ranger and some other things. 
I dont like the soft corners or the rounded corners because they are not consistent because some apps have all the corners rounded and some dont. I also dont use any app runner like Rofi or Dmenu or anything. 

I use Pop shell for tiling like everybody and you should too. I am not using the POP shell from Pop!_OS but [Sharp Shell](https://github.com/Deottive/Sharp-Shell) which is customized by me which have no rounded corners also I dont have the active window borders dark but they are thin. 

## What I am using ❓

1. **DE** : [Gnome](https://github.com/GNOME) Simplicity 👣
2. **File manager** : [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) I also have a devicon patch for icons 🗃️
3. **Terminal** : [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) Fastest terminal 🍉
4. **Panel** : [Dash to Panel](https://github.com/home-sweet-gnome/dash-to-panel) Customizability 🫀
5. **Fonts** : [Nerd Fonts ](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) For Icons ✍️ 
6. **Terminal** : Kitty 🐱

## TODO ✅
1. I want to add more themes like Solarized but config for alacritty is missing 
2. Link the internal folders 
3. Try WM someday, I have tried them but some stuff just does not work and then I give up
4. Bash or Some Script to change everything from one command, I am learning programming so I have to learn that too
